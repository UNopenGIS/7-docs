# Brand Guidelines

## Naming Guidelines

### Principles
1. We would like to keep our names simple, easy to remember, and understood. 
2. We want to make our text short as possible. For this reason, we prefer short names. 
3. We would like to take our priviledge to make use of UN brand where appropriate. On the other hand, we want to be considerate not to assume the name of the UN. We do not want anyone to feel cheated. 

### Guidelines
1. We normally use **UN Smart Maps** when it is appropriate. We want to use this as *our standard brand*. 
2. Sometimes we simply say **Smart Maps** as _nickname_ in some casual and friendly context. 
3. We add specific words after **Smart Maps** to identify something under our activitiy. For example: **Smart Maps Meetup**, **Smart Maps Bazaar**, **Smart Maps Group**, and maybe **Smart Maps Portable** in future. It is OK to use UN as a prefix. However, we also wanto to keep our names short, preferably less than 3 words. 
4. We always use **Maps** in plural form. We do not use **Smart Map** in singular form. 
5. We also add **DWG** and **7** when it is necessary or appropriate. But we still want our brand simple and easy to remember. That is why we normally use **UN Smart Maps**. 
6. In Japanese language, **国連スマート地図** would be *our standard brand*.
