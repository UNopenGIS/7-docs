# Global Compact on Refugees: Closing the Digital Gender Gap

## Pledge description
The OpenGeoCommunity for GRF2023, led by the UN Smart Maps Group of the UN Open GIS Initiative, The UN Smart Maps Group and UN Open GIS Initiative have committed to a pledge to empower refugees through geospatial information technology over the medium to long term. 

This initiative involves providing refugees with essential web and Geographic Information System (GIS) skills, utilizing tools like UNVT (United Nations Vector Tile Toolkit) Portable powered by Raspberry Pi. The program is designed to facilitate learning in environments even remote from the internet and power grids, emphasizing the potential for offline digital skills training. 
By doing so, it seeks to explore the possibility of refugees becoming digital talents who can contribute to the public good. The pledge also focuses on disseminating this technology to a broader audience, underlining a commitment to preventing the creation of more refugees. 

KPI for this initiative includes implementing digital skills training for 100 refugees by 2027 and establishing a system capable of responding to crisis situations, thereby contributing to the prevention and resolution of refugee issues.

To enhance this pledge, the following contributions can be integrated:
Training Documentation for Web Mapping: Developing comprehensive training materials specifically for web mapping would be crucial in equipping refugees with the necessary skills to utilize GIS technologies effectively.
Tools for Localization in Local Languages: Providing tools that support localization in various local languages, such as Arabic. This is particularly important as it ensures that the training and resources are accessible to refugees from different linguistic backgrounds, broadening the initiative's impact.

These contributions aim to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of the training provided to refugees, ensuring that they can fully leverage the potential of geospatial technologies. By focusing on localization and comprehensive training documentation, the initiative can be more inclusive and impactful, catering to the diverse needs of refugees across different regions.
