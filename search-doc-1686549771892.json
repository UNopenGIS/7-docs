It is OK to use UN as a prefix. However, we also wanto to keep our names short, preferably less than 4 words. We always use Maps in plural form. We do not use Smart Map in singular form.

By enabling easy sharing, access, and processing of vector geospatial data, we can save time and costs needed to utilize geospatial information. Additionally, the cloud optimization allows for easier integration with different applications, making it commonly accessible to more people, who can then utilize geospatial information to make better decisions. This approach is also forward-looking and inclusive, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the power of open geospatial information. Acquiring and configuring servers in deploying UNVT was a bit of a headache. With cloud-optimized geospatial information, the server-side processing is not as complex. If we can also provision cost-effective, high-capacity, and flexible storage on-demand, we can share even more timely geospatial information. This will enable us to further enhance the accessibility and utilization of geospatial information for everyone. Furthermore, access to geospatial information is expanding to include data from UAVs, LiDAR, 3D point clouds, and 3D city models related to facility management and smart cities. These datasets are significantly larger than vector-based base map information, and without innovative storage technologies, server issues could hinder the utilization of geospatial information. "},{"title":"Introduction of the basic idea, pros and consâ€‹","type":1,"pageTitle":"Smart Maps Bazaar Walking Tour","url":"/smartmaps/get-involved/events/smart-maps-bazaar#introduction-of-the-basic-idea-pros-and-cons","content":"The idea of a decentralized web is gaining new implementations under the keyword of Web3. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a relatively fast, stable, and secure implementation of a decentralized web. The idea of sharing cloud-optimized geospatial information using IPFS was born out of the encounter with this technology. The basic idea behind Smart Maps Bazaar is to store cloud-optimized geospatial information on IPFS and share it with applications through gateways that provide open access. In implementation, an IPFS gateway for open access to cloud-optimized file sharing is called Smart Maps Bazaar. To list cloud-optimized geospatial information on Smart Maps Bazaar, one simply needs to add the geospatial information to their IPFS node and share the resulting content identifier with the application. Prosâ€‹ One of the pros for this idea is that it allows for IPFS nodes necessary for information sharing to be made much more affordable. As the amount of geospatial data to be shared grows, there may be cases where the demand for access speed for individual geospatial data decreases. This may make it possible to allocate reasonably priced storage for data with low access speed requirements. Moreover, the concept of &quot;pinning&quot; is present in IPFS. By pinning data to one's own node, it may be possible to carry the data offline. This feature could also potentially work as a cache to enhance access speed at devices or sites. Consâ€‹ One challenge of this idea is the lack of established methods to implement access restrictions. For the time being, it may be best to limit the Smart Maps Bazaar idea to existing open data or unclassified data. However, unclassified data is often massive in scale, and applying this idea to unclassified data alone could still lead to cost reductions.
