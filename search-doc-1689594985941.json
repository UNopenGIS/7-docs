It is OK to use UN as a prefix. However, we also wanto to keep our names short, preferably less than 4 words. We always use Maps in plural form. We do not use Smart Map in singular form. We also add DWG and 7 when it is necessary or appropriate. But we still want our brand simple and easy to remember. That is why we normally use UN Smart Maps.
